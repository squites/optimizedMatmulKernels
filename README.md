# optimizedMatmulKernels
This project is a replication of the article "How to Optimize a CUDA Matmul kernel for cuBLAS-like Performance: a Worklog". The intention of this repo is to implement the different matrix multiplication kernels, gradually improving performance. The main goal is to sharpen CUDA skills and knowledge about GPU optimization and efficiency, exploring these many optimizations that you can do.

## Installation
